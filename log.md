# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for a 12-month Front-End Developer online course with an institution based in Europe called Open Classrooms. Off-the-bat I was given assignments such as: typing up a Word doc answering some questions, updating my resume, updating my linkedin, and creating a study journal (this 100-days-of-code repo will act as such.) 

Afterwards I learned some preliminary stuff regarding the differences between "the web" and "the internet." I also completed a short quiz and received 90%.

**Thoughts:** Everything is so fresh and new. I feel like the information is being provided in bite-sized doses which is really nice and not too overwhelming. I'm interested to see how this curriculum pans out in the months to come. ðŸ˜€


### Day 2: January 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I completed my entire "Learn how to learn!" module and got 100% on 3 of my quizzes. I began the next module "Integrate a WordPress theme for a client" and opted to begin the HTML/CSS course first, but instead of completing it thoroughly I attempted to install a live-server from an old tutorial wrote up a while back. 

Unfortunately, my live-server doesn't reload my page nor did a different plugin called Browser Sync work either. If I'm going to continue these modules, I prefer to have my web pages reload in real-time. Hum. A problem to be solved on another day.

### Day 3: January 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I completed both the Your first web page in HTML and Organizing your text sections on (OC).

**Thoughts:** Everything thus far is a reintroduction to what I already know, but may have forgotten due to months of not practicing the code. I can't help but feel there might be a better way to learn this material. I have been exposed to so many sources and methods of learning, I am questioning if I should reaasses and determine the most preferable way for me to learn.


### Day 4: January 11th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I skivved Open Classrooms today and instead organized and reviewed 74 saved Web Development-related posts I had on Facebook. Additionally I reviewed a few Reddit posts re: preferred methods and websites to learn Front-End Development. I participated in a very brief introduction of Udacity's Front-End Development path and I was impressed by their cinematography and narration, but need to engage more with their interactive system to make a firm conclusion on if I should enroll with them instead.

**Thoughts:** I need to thoroughly filter and review all my resources to determine which way of learning is best suitable for me.


### Day 5: January 12th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I took the night off from coding, not because I didn't want to, but because I want to aggregate the appropriate coding resources that will enable me to learn more efficiently moving forward. I did do more research and read reviews on Udacity's Front End Developer program.

**Thoughts:** I'm seriously considering switching over to Udacity Front End Developer program course soon.

### Day 6: January 13th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: R&R Day.

### Day 7: January 14th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: R&R Day.

### Day 8: January 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I added a few Typora (markdown editor) themes to my PC. I also installed some themes and plugins for my Sublime Text 3 text editor. I went through a few Prog-8 Git courses.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I need to brush up on my Git and Sublime Text skills before going full throttle into Front-End.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
