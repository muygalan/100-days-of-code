# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for a 12-month Front-End Developer online course with an institution based in Europe called Open Classrooms. Off-the-bat I was given assignments such as: typing up a Word doc answering some questions, updating my resume, updating my linkedin, and creating a study journal (this 100-days-of-code repo will act as such.) 

Afterwards I learned some preliminary stuff regarding the differences between "the web" and "the internet." I also completed a short quiz and received 90%.

**Thoughts:** Everything is so fresh and new. I feel like the information is being provided in bite-sized doses which is really nice and not too overwhelming. I'm interested to see how this curriculum pans out in the months to come. ðŸ˜€

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
