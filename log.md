# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I signed up for Udacity's 6-month Front End Development course. I originally signed up for Open Classrooms 12-month Front-End Development course, but ultimately decided it was not for me. I'm hoping as I continue along with Udacity I will find that it's presentation style is better fit for my learning. Today I completed the entire "HTML Syntax" track.

**Thoughts:** Having had previous experience learning HTML in my past, it's honestly difficult for me to fall head over heels with any 'one' online course because I feel I have gained valuable bits of information from a culmination of resources (i.e. books, youtube, websites, udemy, etc.) No method seems to be one-stop shop, but I'm hoping Udacity proves to be a valuable investment.

### Day 2: February 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "HTML Syntax Problem Set". It featured an extension called the Udacity Front End Feedback Extension found in the Chrome Web Store. It basically gives you feedback on if you're coding the exercises correctly. (Pretty cool.) I went through and succeeding with the following: Making Header sizes 1-4, HTML Tree Structures, Hyperlinks, Images, Relatives/External Paths, Figure/Figcaption, and finally mockup to website.

**Thoughts:** By the end of the this particual track, I must admit I am enjoying the flow and the learning process Udacity has implemented thus far. Fingers crossed this continues as such! âœŒ

### Day 3: February 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed: An Article to Mockup, Getting Started with CSS, Attributes and Selectors, CSS Units, and CSS Colors.

**Thoughts:** I'm amazed at how much code I actually have memorized deep down in the cellars of my mind. As I'm following along, a lot of the previous information I learned over the years suddenly resurfaced and thensome. I'm definitely rusty when it comes to HTML/CSS, but I truly due recall many of the tags and selectors being presented. Good stuff!

### Day 4: February 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed: CSS Syntax Problem Set which included: Style an Image (quiz), Style the Font (quiz), Writing Selectors, Using Attributes, a Slack Card (quiz), and a Udacity Site Header (quiz.)

**Thoughts:** We delved more into developer tools for some of these quizzes which I wasn't too fond of (I prefer using an actual text editor - Sublime Text), but dev tools are a natural part of being a Front-End Developer and are important in the real world. I succeeded in all my quizzes with the exception of the Slack Card quiz. I need to revisit it, look into the forums, or consult my mentor for future help.

I feel as if I had other things that prevented me from studying as long as I could have tonight, but I will be more conscientious of when I begin my studies.

### Day 5: February 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed: Writing Code Faster, Sublime Keyboard Layouts, Packages and Themes

**Thoughts:** Got to revisit and definitely learn a LOT of new Sublime Text 3 shortcuts. Hopefully I can memorize them all!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
