# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I signed up for Udacity's 6-month Front End Development course. I originally signed up for Open Classrooms 12-month Front-End Development course, but ultimately decided it was not for me. I'm hoping as I continue along with Udacity I will find that it's presentation style is better fit for my learning. Today I completed the entire "HTML Syntax" track.

**Thoughts:** Having had previous experience learning HTML in my past, it's honestly difficult for me to fall head over heels with any 'one' online course because I feel I have gained valuable bits of information from a culmination of resources (i.e. books, youtube, websites, udemy, etc.) No method seems to be one-stop shop, but I'm hoping Udacity proves to be a valuable investment.

### Day 2: February 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "HTML Syntax Problem Set". It featured an extension called the Udacity Front End Feedback Extension found in the Chrome Web Store. It basically gives you feedback on if you're coding the exercises correctly. (Pretty cool.) I went through and succeeding with the following: Making Header sizes 1-4, HTML Tree Structures, Hyperlinks, Images, Relatives/External Paths, Figure/Figcaption, and finally mockup to website.

**Thoughts:** By the end of the this particual track, I must admit I am enjoying the flow and the learning process Udacity has implemented thus far. Fingers crossed this continues as such! âœŒ

### Day 3: February 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed: An Article to Mockup, Getting Started with CSS, Attributes and Selectors, CSS Units, and CSS Colors.

**Thoughts:** I'm amazed at how much code I actually have memorized deep down in the cellars of my mind. As I'm following along, a lot of the previous information I learned over the years suddenly resurfaced and thensome. I'm definitely rusty when it comes to HTML/CSS, but I truly due recall many of the tags and selectors being presented. Good stuff!

### Day 4: February 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed: CSS Syntax Problem Set which included: Style an Image (quiz), Style the Font (quiz), Writing Selectors, Using Attributes, a Slack Card (quiz), and a Udacity Site Header (quiz.)

**Thoughts:** We delved more into developer tools for some of these quizzes which I wasn't too fond of (I prefer using an actual text editor - Sublime Text), but dev tools are a natural part of being a Front-End Developer and are important in the real world. I succeeded in all my quizzes with the exception of the Slack Card quiz. I need to revisit it, look into the forums, or consult my mentor for future help.

I feel as if I had other things that prevented me from studying as long as I could have tonight, but I will be more conscientious of when I begin my studies.

### Day 5: February 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed: Writing Code Faster, Sublime Keyboard Layouts, Packages and Themes

**Thoughts:** Got to revisit and definitely learn a LOT of new Sublime Text 3 shortcuts. Hopefully I can memorize them all!

### Day 6: February 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed my first project: Animal Trading Card.

**Thoughts:** It took me about an hour to complete the project. Relatively easy, but had to look up a few CSS selectors. I felt like it was an appropriate first project to practice what I've learned. Waiting on someone to review my project within 24 hours. 


### Day 7: February 13th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Why Responsive?" course and setup using dev tools on the mobile.

**Thoughts:** This was a decent course as it showed me a few new features on using dev tools. I thought it was really cool how it showed me how to setup dev tools to by synced from my laptop to mobile device.

### Day 8: February 14th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Start Small" course module.

**Thoughts:** I was dreading and looking forward to this course. I understand the importance of responsive web design. And although this course was intended to be introductory to screen sizes and viewports, I felt the content was rushed over too quickly and confusing. They could have done a better job of explaining the topics a bit better, but that's just my 2cents. Hopefully the next lesson covers the material in a more understandable way. 

### Day 9: February 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got 2/3 through the "Building Up" course odule.

**Thoughts:** Media Queries and Breakpoints make sense and are confusing to me too. Again, I feel like its a lot to process for my feeble brain. I found myself searching Google for more in-depth articles that can "break" down these concepts further. Although I don't mind doing additional research, it kind of irritates me since I am paying for this course and expected for my to understand the material better without having to rely too much on external sources.


### Day 10: February 19th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 1/3 "Building Up" course module and began the Common Responsive Patterns module.

**Thoughts:** These past 2 modules have sucked. The breeze over the material so quickly and don't thoroughly cover the nuances that I KNOW media queries and flexbox have in their repertoire. I'm actually considering putting Udacity and hold and seeking books, videos, and other course to temporarily get a better understanding on this material. 

### Day 11: February 20th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from learning on Udacity and read some material on RWD from Shay Howe's website. I also started watching videos on Responsive Web Design from The Net Ninja's channel on YouTube and go through up to "Responsive Web Design Tutorial #5 - Media Queries"

**Thoughts:** I have read from Shay Howe's website in the past and watched The Net Ninja videos before approx. 2-3 years ago. TNN has informative, bite-sized videos that are to the point, show you live examples, and include slides with text (for people like me who usually need to SEE words for retention purposes) and his content is free! I'm wondering if I should cancel my Udacity membership to cut costs and resort to free or inexpensive learning resources (e.g. Team Treehouse, Udacity, etc.) Time will tell. 

### Day 12: February 21st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched up to The Net Ninja's "Responsive Web Design Tutorial #8 - Mobile Styles" video.

**Thoughts:** I didn't study code as much as I would have liked to tonight. I have a headache and feel a bit dizzy. On top of that I feel drained after a long day and I'm also knackered. Hopefully tomorrow I can focus a bit better!

### Day 13: February 22nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I didn't study code today, but I did add a lot of documentation to my mkdocs page that I'm building for the "Jekyll H2O Theme" doc. 

**Thoughts:** I almost didn't code at all tonight (horrible headache), but I got the urge to work on my documentation. I also downloaded these free programming books from a Facebook Group I'm a member off. They are very well written and I look forward to reading them.

### Day 14: February 26th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Woke up early in the AM and worked on my landing page for my personal website. Finish modifying the land page at night and pushed it up to Github.

**Thoughts:** I wish I could take sole credit for the landing page, but the template was included with a CSS book I purchased. I did add a few of my own personal touches and felt it came out great. I need more time to review the book to properly understand all the concepts required to create the page from the ground up. 

### Day 15: March 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Purchased a discounted annual subscription of TeamTreehouse. Watched 4 "Windows Command Line Tutorial" videos from The New Boston on YouTube.

**Thoughts:** I know it seems like I have't posted my progress in a while, but I have good reasons. I actually have been working on a few things on my Github account such as adding a "monthly" repo to review each month during the year with personal thoughts and events that happened throughout the year. (I just didn't feel compelled to add that information here, although I should have.)

Secondly, I haven't been motivated to use Udacity since I encountered the fast pace regarding media queries and responsive websites section. I felt for the money I'm dishing out every month, I'm better off learning via cheaper or free resources such as TeamTreehouse, Udemy, and even YouTube. There is content available out there that suits my learning style much better. My primary fear is not having a mentor or a forum that can address my coding issues in a timely fashion. 

My other concern is not being able to build solid projects through independent learning, but I may have found some reputable Udemy courses online that can help in that area, I just need to do more research. I also am building my own Front-End Developer curriculum.

### Day 16: March 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Progate's command line course. Added a "command" directory to my mkdocs with a bunch of common bash/terminal commands. Watched 2 more "Windows Command Line Tutorial" videos from YouTube.

**Thoughts:** I typed up a lot of documentation, but felt I could being doing much more. (I'm just super tired.)

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
