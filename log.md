# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I signed up for Udacity's 6-month Front End Development course. I originally signed up for Open Classrooms 12-month Front-End Development course, but ultimately decided it was not for me. I'm hoping as I continue along with Udacity I will find that it's presentation style is better fit for my learning. Today I completed the entire "HTML Syntax" track.

**Thoughts:** Having had previous experience learning HTML in my past, it's honestly difficult for me to fall head over heels with any 'one' online course because I feel I have gained valuable bits of information from a culmination of resources (i.e. books, youtube, websites, udemy, etc.) No method seems to be one-stop shop, but I'm hoping Udacity proves to be a valuable investment.

### Day 2: February 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "HTML Syntax Problem Set". It featured an extension called the Udacity Front End Feedback Extension found in the Chrome Web Store. It basically gives you feedback on if you're coding the exercises correctly. (Pretty cool.) I went through and succeeding with the following: Making Header sizes 1-4, HTML Tree Structures, Hyperlinks, Images, Relatives/External Paths, Figure/Figcaption, and finally mockup to website.

**Thoughts:** By the end of the this particual track, I must admit I am enjoying the flow and the learning process Udacity has implemented thus far. Fingers crossed this continues as such! âœŒ

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
